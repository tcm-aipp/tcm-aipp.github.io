The property theory of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is a unique medical framework developed over thousands of years, guiding practitioners in selecting appropriate medicines based on their target organs, flavors, and toxicities.

However, accurately identifying TCM properties remains a challenge, hindering both clinical application and drug discovery.

Herein, the TCM Artificial Intelligence-Powered Platform (TCM-AIPP) was constructed utilizing deep learning technologies.
It includes three tools that identify potential target organs, flavors and toxicities of TCMs, respectively, and offer the rich data output, including the detailed information of chemical profiling and target profiling of TCMs, as well as the corresponding functional enrichment results.

Notably, TCM-AIPP also provides flexible network visualizations, allowing users to explore relationships among TCMs, compounds, targets, organs, flavors, and toxicities. Collectively, this web server is of great significance to enhance the understanding of TCM properties, support clinical practice, and aid in TCM-derived drug R&D.
