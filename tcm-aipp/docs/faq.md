## 1. Introduction

<p style={{ textAlign: "justify", textIndent: "2em" }}>
    The property theory of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is a unique medical theory based on extensive clinical practice for thousands of years, guiding TCM practitioners in choosing proper medicines to treat specific diseases. The target organs, flavors, and toxicities of TCM are a high generalization of the drug's characteristics according to the property theory. Despite intensive investigations, the accurate identification of TCM properties still confronts several challenges, which greatly hampers the clinical rational application and novel drug discovery of TCM.
</p>
<p style={{ textAlign: "justify", textIndent: "2em" }}>
Herein, the TCM Artificial Intelligence-Powered Platform (TCM-AIPP) has been developed leveraging state-of-the-art deep learning technologies. TCM-AIPP contains three predictive tools that not only identify the potential target organs, tastes and toxicities of TCM, but also provide comprehensive information on TCMs and corresponding compounds, including candidate target profiling and functional enrichment data. Notably, this web server offers flexible and diverse forms of network visualization, for which users can choose to display different relationships among herbs, compounds, targets, target organs, flavors, and toxicities according to their research aims, as well as design and modify the network nodes and edges at will.
</p>
<p style={{ textAlign: "justify", textIndent: "2em" }}>
Uncovering the properties of TCM is of great importance for both clinical applications and TCM-derived drug R&D. TCM-AIPP may help to facilitate the recognition of the properties of TCMs, explain the underlying mechanisms of TCM against various human diseases, and provide guidance for TCM practitioners.

## 2. Model Info

### 2.1 Model information and validation
<p style={{ textAlign: "justify", textIndent: "2em" }}>
A total of three tools for predicting target organs, flavors and toxicities of TCMs were constructed and developed in the TCM-AIPP web server based on Random Forest (RF) machine learning and Graph Attention Network (GAT), respectively. These tools contain 19 prediction models, including 10 classification models and 9 regression models. For each endpoint, the dataset is randomly divided into training, validation (VAL) and test sets in the ratio of 8:1:1. The RF model is implemented using the tree ensemble learner and predictor nodes in KNIME, Gini coefficient is used for segmentation criteria, square root function is used for attribute sampling and different sets of attributes are selected for all trees. The GAT employs an Adam optimizer with hyperparameter tuning via Bayesian optimization. The regression task was assessed using the coefficient of determination (R2), root mean squared error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE), whereas the classification task was evaluated based on accuracy, the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC-AUC) curve, Mathews correlation coefficient (MCC), precision, specificity and sensitivity. To guarantee the reliability and precision of the models, each training process was conducted 10 times, and the most effective models were then deployed to the online platform.
</p>

### 2.2 TCM target organ prediction
<p style={{ textAlign: "justify", textIndent: "2em" }}>
The TCM target organ prediction model was developed based on GAT, which aims to reveal the action tendency of TCM on different organs. The targets of TCM are complex and diverse, and their mechanisms of action are difficult to explain intuitively, so they need to be accurately predicted by systematic network analysis methods. This model can effectively predict the effects of TCM on specific organs by integrating the information of human protein-protein interaction (PPI) network (1) and the effective targets of TCM.
</p>
<p style={{ textAlign: "justify", textIndent: "2em" }}>
The model was constructed based on a number of reliable data sources. Proteins specifically expressed in each organ were collected from The Human Protein Atlas. These proteins were screened for "Enhanced" and "High" levels of evidence, and occurring only once in all organs. To further substantiate the independence of organ target sets within the PPI network, a network separation analysis was employed to differentiate between organ-specific target sets. In the GAT, organ-specific targets were mapped to the PPI network, and interactions between protein nodes were analyzed through the graph attention mechanism to calculate the specificity scores of different protein nodes for each organ. The model weights integrate the organ-specific scores of each target according to the combination of the effective targets of the TCM, thereby more accurately predicting the tendency of the TCM to target specific organs.
</p>
<p style={{ textAlign: "justify", textIndent: "2em" }}>
To validate the performance of the model, we collected effective target data with high-quality literature support from the HIT database, which demonstrated optimal prediction quality in several models. A total of 442 TCMs with documented organ effects, as recorded in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia, were subjected to extraction of their corresponding effective targets, amounting to a total of 64,795. During the validation process, if the actual organ of target of a TCM was located in the top three organs predicted by the model (a single TCM is known to target on up to 4 organs), the prediction was considered to be a true-positive result. The model was initially validated for the four organs of the liver, heart, lungs, and kidneys (as documented in the Pharmacopoeia) and achieved a more satisfactory model performance. Subsequently, the validation was extended to encompass modeling of additional organs, including the cerebellum, pancreas, retina, skeletal muscle, and testis. Notably, with the exception of the heart-skeletal muscle, the target sets of these organs showed significant topological separation in the PPI, which further enhanced the predictive performance of the model.

### 2.3 TCM flavor prediction
<p style={{ textAlign: "justify", textIndent: "2em" }}>
The flavor prediction model of TCM-AIPP was constructed using the RF algorithm. This model evaluates the chemical structural similarities between the input compounds and compounds with known flavors obtained from PubChem, VirtualTaste and ChemTastesDB.
</p>
<p style={{ textAlign: "justify", textIndent: "2em" }}>
Then, the flavors of TCM were predicted by weighted averaging the compounds' flavors, especially the index compounds recorded by the Chinese Pharmacopoeia 2020 and the other compounds were assigned different weights. The predictive performance of this model was evaluated based on 558 TCMs with the flavor records in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia 2020 and the corresponding 19,068 compounds obtained from BATMAN-TCM. If the actual flavors of a certain TCM are included in the top three predicted flavors of the model (it is generally known that a single TCM have up to 3 flavors), the result may be considered to be true-positive.

### 2.4 TCM toxicity prediction
<p style={{ textAlign: "justify", textIndent: "2em" }}>
The toxicity prediction model of TCM-AIPP was constructed using the GAT algorithm.  This model evaluates the chemical structural similarities between the input compounds and compounds with known toxicities obtained from TOXRIC, DIRIL, DrugBank and PubChem. On this basis, TCM-AIPP can predict the potential toxicities [acute and organ toxicities (including cardiotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, neurotoxicity, and respiratory toxicity)] of the input compounds and the toxic risk of TCMs according to the number of toxic compounds in the chemical profiling. In addition, TCM-AIPP also provides the putative targets of the toxic compounds containing TCMs and their enriched biological functions and pathways. These data provide an important reference for the safety evaluation of TCMs and the investigation of the underlying toxic mechanisms.
</p>

#### 2.4.1 Acute toxicity
<p style={{ textAlign: "justify", textIndent: "2em" }}>
Two prediction models for acute toxicity were developed for different application scenarios based on rat and mouse using the LD50 data collected from the TOXRIC database and the toxicity classification criteria referring to the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals. To minimize the risk of false negatives and to reduce overfitting, both the Random Oversampling and Adaptive Synthetic Sampling Algorithm (ADASYN) were used to improve the classification accuracy for a few classes of chemicals. The results of the two sampling algorithms are both available on the platform.

#### 2.4.2 Cardiotoxicity
<p style={{ textAlign: "justify", textIndent: "2em" }}>
Accumulating studies have reported the cardiotoxicity induced by drugs, which may be usually associated with the inhibition of human ether-à-go-go-related gene (hERG). hERG genes encode proteins that form potassium channels in the membranes of cardiomyocytes, which are essential for normal electrical activity of the heart, especially during the repolarization phase. Many drugs can inadvertently inhibit hERG channels, causing abnormal repolarization of the heart, which lead to arrhythmias and even sudden death. To construct the cardiotoxicity prediction model for TCM-AIPP, compounds with hERG inhibition values were obtained from the ChEMBL database and categorized into four classes of cardiotoxicity based on their IC50 value.

## 3. User Guide

### 3.1 Input information
<p style={{textAlign: "justify"}}>
The TCM-AIPP web server provides an intuitive and user-friendly interactive interface for users to easily enter official gene symbols individually or in batches to predict target organs or Simplified Molecular-Input Line Entry System (SMILES) strings of compounds to predict their flavors, acute toxicities, and organ toxicities. 
</p>

### 3.2 Output information
<p style={{textAlign: "justify"}}>
Depending on the number of elements entered by the user, the prediction results will be presented in the browser in the form of diversified charts and tables. In the target organ prediction interface, when the user enters a single gene, the system provides information on the related TCMs of the gene, the prediction results of the target organ, and the secondary network interacting with the input gene; if multiple genes are entered in a batch, the results include a summary of the target organ classification of all the genes, the related TCMs, and information on TCMs significantly enriched according to their effective targets. The flavor or toxicity prediction webpage provides the flavor, acute toxicity, organ toxicity prediction results of compounds, related TCMs, candidate targets, and biological function enrichment analysis based on the input SMILES. For batch input, the result will present a categorized summary of all prediction results, information on related TCMs and significantly enriched according to the components contained in the TCMs, candidate targets and corresponding biological function enrichment analysis, and support network visualization to clearly show the relationship between TCMs-compounds-targets. The methodologies employed for target prediction and enrichment analysis have been previously delineated in our research publications (25). The new server allows users to download the results in several file formats: .csv, .png, .svg, and .sif (which supports linking to Cytoscape for further customization and analysis). 
</p>

### 3.3 Processing times
<p style={{ textAlign: "justify", textIndent: "2em" }}>
TCM-AIPP is capable of processing a single input of up to 3000 targets or 1000 SMILES, facilitating the prediction of the target organ of a certain target, as well as the flavor and toxicity of a certain compound. In terms of computational efficiency, when the server queue is free and the resources are sufficient, the prediction output time of a single model is controlled to be less than 1 minute, thereby meeting the requirement of efficient computation.
</p>

### 3.4 Quick start

**NOTE: Two sampling methods were used to predict acute toxicity (see 2.4.1). For the same compound, we recommend selecting the lower grade as the reference. This approach is more conservative and is designed to avoid false negatives, which are more harmful than false positives. The reliable scores of candidate targets provided herein are higher than 0.6.**

## 4. API Tutorial
<p style={{ textAlign: "justify", textIndent: "2em" }}>
For users with more advanced analytical requirements, TCM-AIPP offers a straightforward POST interface that enables data to be queried through the programming language of your choice. While the site responds quickly, there may be a slight delay in Python scripts due to the queuing of user requests. Please note that a maximum of 100 API queries can be made per source IP per day, with query intervals becoming longer as the number of requesting models increases. To run the script, the system must have Python (version 3.12 or higher) installed and executed from the command line.
